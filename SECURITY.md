# Security Guidelines

This document contains the security guidelines for the Azure Terraform community project. Security is something to take seriously, and if there is any concerns then please reach out as soon as possible.

In our project we will not have many scenarios where there is a serious security breach, as we will mainly have a collection of Terraform modules, but there might be times where there might be concerns about implementation methods or default values. If this is the case, please use the _security concern_ form on the repository in question and provide any links to documentation to support your claim.
